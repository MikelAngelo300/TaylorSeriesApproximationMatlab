# TaylorSeriesApproximation

This MATLAB project implements Taylor series expansions to approximate functions like \( e^{ax} \) and \( \cos(ax) \). It calculates the approximations for different iterations, evaluates the accuracy using RMSE, and visualizes the results with plots.

## Features

- Taylor series approximation for \( e^{ax} \) and \( \cos(ax) \).
- Evaluation of approximation error using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
- Visualization of approximation accuracy over different iterations.
- Modular code with separate functions for each approximation type.

## Usage

1. Open the project folder in MATLAB.
2. Run the main script `test_for exponent.m` or `test_for cosine.m` to perform the Taylor series approximation for different functions and visualize the results.
3. You can modify the parameters (e.g., `x0`, `a`, `N`) to explore different approximations.

## Results

The generated plots will compare the Taylor series approximation to the actual function and show the RMSE error across iterations.
